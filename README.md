# D3-Challenge

Create a scatter plot between two (or more) data variables.


### Purpose

The core purpose of this assignment is to create a scatter plot between data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age. The dataset id based on 2014 ACS 1 year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/).The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty etc. by state.


### D3 Dabbler

Using D3 techniques, scatter plot was created that represents each state with circle element. The graphic was coded in the `app.js`

    * Include state abbreviations in the circles.

    * Create and situate the axes and labels to the left and   bottom of the chart.


Following is the chart of Healthcare vs. Poverty:
